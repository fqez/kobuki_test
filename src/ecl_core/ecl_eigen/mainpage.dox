\section packageSummary Package Summary

This is a package that stores the eigen header files. You can either
use it directly, or better still, interface it through ecl_linear_algebra
which provides a few extra features.

\section Eigen3

Currently using version 3.01 and also includes the unsupported modules.

I had to edit the Eigen3/src/StlSupport headers to dereference correctly (they're hardcoded
to Eigen paths).
