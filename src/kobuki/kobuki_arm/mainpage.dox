\section Overview

In addition to providing an overview of your package,
this is the section where the specification and design/architecture 
should be detailed. This is strictly a reference to the api and 
usage of that api in its barest form. While it should strive to 
be complete, it should not become unnecessarily burdened with usage
ideas and notes.
